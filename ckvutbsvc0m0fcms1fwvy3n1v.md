## Don't be me.

TL;DR - *Personal story about me not admitting I like tech as the popular guy in the 90's and wasting close to 20 professional years to jobs I did not like.*

I moved around a lot when I was a kid. **A lot.** I'm not exaggerating if I tell you I visited two schools per year. It made me socially strong, capable of making friends wherever I went, shaping my image school after school, until I had some kind of go-to character that I could introduce to my new environment and that would work anywhere, in any situation.

Now that's the good part. **I'm the guy that gets noticed when he walks in a room.** I can adapt to different situations and blend in like a cameleon or stand out and change the whole situation to my liking. 

The sad part is that the character I formed (popular, fun-loving, athletic) did not allow the geek inside to surface. 

I remember us having a computer at home that could be loaded with cassette tapes. You would run the tape to a certain point and it would play a 'game' or a piece of music. I do not remember the brand of the thing, just that it had an red, plastic monitor with a black screen and white letters. They would sometimes turn green, but a good whack against the monitor would fix that.

**And I loved it.** I could write line after line and record it to the tape and then play what I just told it to play. Over and over again. In a language that I don't recall either, but it must've been BASIC considering I couldn't have been older than 10.

Now you might think that a healthy interest in computers would've been applauded and motivated by people that cared for me. **Wrong.** This was the '90's. Computers were for nerds with bad skin and a serious lack of sexual intercourse. This did not fit in my default character that I so thoroughly had shaped over all these years. So every time I found myself into tech like the first mobile phones or the first modems to get online, I'd pretend I didn't care much. It didn't fit the profile, right?

So I did what a guy does, I traveled, became a police officer in Amsterdam, then a prisonguard in the worst prison of the Netherlands and spent the next 10 years living a life that I had carefully sculpted out of laziness. Because that's what it was. Laziness.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't lived a sad story. I got married, we were blessed with two kids and then I married the same girl 10 years later again, just because she is the absolute best.  But still, no tech, although I was fixing computers for friends and family, reading up on Linux and developing a taste for smartphones in my spare time.

Even in my early 30's, when I decided to actually get a degree next to my fulltime job, I went for Economics. **Not a Computer Science degree, but Economics.** Why? Because my brain would not allow me to step away from my prejudice against tech and it's geekiness. For years I would watch YouTube tutorials about app development and smartphone architecture, but when I got the chance I decided I needed to study Economics. Miserable piece of person, me.

It took me 37 years to come out. I finally convinced myself it's okay to be a nerd. A baldheaded,  fitnesscrazy nerd. I even asked my employer if they were interested in helping me educate myself the right way. And they were.
I went from Android with Java to Ionic with Angular and I'm currently learning Flutter with Dart, the latter giving me so much joy and happiness I just wish I had found it sooner.

Now the reason I'm writing this stuff is because I don't want you to be me. I'm mad at myself for not letting myself be me professionally. I regret the 'lost' years in my professional life. It feels like I have 20 years of catching up to do, while I have been in jobs and studies that I only started because me and my environment expected me to be doing those things. **Don't lose time, you only get one life.** Do what your heart tells you to do.

Do not give up on your true interests, just because you think it doesn't fit your profile.

**Change the freaking profile.**
